[Link to Live Site](placeholder for link)
The purpose of this application is to provide an interactive space to search weather conditions by city, displaying not only current information, but also a five day forecast. This project serves as an exercize in API requests, use of local storage, and the use of outside frameworks for styling (Bootstrap v4.6). Ultimately, the JS is utilized to drive the functionality of the page, allowing for variable manipulation and event delegation, providing the user with a clean display of requested weather data.
